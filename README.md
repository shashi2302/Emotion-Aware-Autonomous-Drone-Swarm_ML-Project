# Emotion-Aware-Autonomous-Drone-Swarm_ML-Project

Innovation in AI and robotics is accelerating, Today, I want to talk about emotion-aware autonomous drone swarms and why hitting "pause" might be the boldest move in tech right now.
Emotion detection is fraught with bias and inaccuracy. Misreading fear as aggression—or calmness as apathy—could lead to dangerous outcomes in life-or-death scenarios.
Who bears responsibility when algorithms fail?
Deploying swarms to analyze human emotions in crises raises huge privacy concerns. Consent is impossible in emergencies, turning rescue tools into surveillance threats.
Imagine drones buzzing overhead, "judging" your emotional state while you’re trapped. Could this escalate panic instead of alleviating it?

Emergencies are chaotic. Can RL models reliably generalize across disasters, cultural contexts, or even individual trauma responses?
A single misstep in swarm coordination could turn drones from helpers into hazards.

Tech used: 
ROS, PyTorch, MQTT.


You would run this script from the command line like this:

python run_drone_swarm.py --num_drones 10 --mode simulation --duration 600

This would:
1. Initialize a swarm of 10 drones
2. Run in simulation mode (rather than controlling real drones)
3. Run for 10 minutes (600 seconds)
4. Save output data to the default directory
